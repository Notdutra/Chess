# Chess Game

This project is a chess game built with React, Vite, and ESLint. The game features full gameplay, including check, checkmate, stalemate, and piece promotion, along with ongoing development for castling, sounds, and other features.

## Features

- **Full gameplay** with check, checkmate, and stalemate detection.
- **Piece promotion** (currently only to Queen, but plans to add a popup for other pieces).
- **Move validation** and proper piece behavior.
- **Endgame screen** (still in progress).
- **Sound effects** for piece movement and capture (to be added).
- **Future updates** planned, including castling, en passant, and drag-and-drop piece movement.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for frontend development.
- **Vite** for fast and efficient bundling.
- **ESLint** for maintaining code quality and consistency.
- **JavaScript** for the logic and interactivity.

## Roadmap

The following features are planned for future updates:

- **Implement Castling Logic**  
  This will allow players to perform castling moves, where the king and a rook can move simultaneously, given certain conditions. This is a key chess rule that will be added to complete the game's gameplay mechanics.

- **Add Drag-and-Drop Functionality for Piece Movement**  
  This feature will enable players to move their pieces by dragging them on the board, providing a more intuitive and interactive experience compared to click-to-move.

- **Create Piece Promotion Popup (for different pieces)**  
  Currently, pieces can only be promoted to a queen. This update will introduce a popup during promotion that allows players to choose between a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.

- **Add Sound Effects for Piece Movement and Capture**  
  To enhance the gaming experience, sound effects will be added for actions such as moving a piece and capturing an opponent's piece. This will make the game feel more dynamic and immersive.

- **Implement En Passant Capture for Pawns**  
  En passant is a special pawn capture rule. This feature will allow pawns to capture an opponentâ€™s pawn that has just moved two squares forward, as long as the capture happens immediately after the move.

- **Implement Endgame Screen**  
  When the game ends, an endgame screen will display the result, whether it's checkmate, stalemate, or a draw. This screen will offer options for players to restart the game or exit.
