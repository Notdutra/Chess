# Chess Game Refactoring Plan

## Main Issues with Current Implementation

1. **DOM Dependencies in Game Logic**
   - Game logic code directly manipulates DOM elements
   - CSS classes are modified inside game logic functions
   - Piece positions are determined by querying DOM elements

2. **Global Mutable State**
   - Many global variables in GameLogic.tsx
   - Side effects across functions due to shared state
   - Difficult to track state changes

3. **Type Safety**
   - Extensive use of `any` type
   - Insufficient interfaces/types for game objects
   - Inconsistent typing approach

4. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI logic mixed with game logic
   - Chess rules intertwined with rendering logic
   - Event handling tied to game state manipulation

## Refactoring Approach

### 1. Create a Domain Model

We've created the following models:

- `GameState`: Comprehensive representation of the game state
- `Piece`: Representation of chess pieces and their attributes
- `Square`: Representation of board squares and their properties
- `Move`: Representation of chess moves and their properties

### 2. Implement Pure Chess Logic

We've created a `ChessEngine` class that:

- Encapsulates all chess rules and game state
- Uses pure functions for game logic
- Has no dependencies on DOM or UI
- Provides a clean API for the UI components

### 3. UI Component Refactoring Plan

1. **Chessboard Component**
   - Use the ChessEngine to manage game state
   - Pass only display-relevant state to child components
   - Handle UI events and delegate logic to ChessEngine

2. **Piece Component**
   - Make it a purely presentational component
   - Remove direct DOM manipulation
   - Use CSS classes controlled by parent components

3. **Square Component**
   - Make it a purely presentational component
   - Handle click/drag events and bubble up to parent
   - Visual state determined by props, not DOM queries

### 4. Implementation Strategy

1. **Step 1: Create Models and Engine** ✅
   - Define clear interfaces for game objects
   - Create a pure chess engine independent of DOM

2. **Step 2: Refactor Chessboard Component** ✅
   - Create new version that uses ChessEngine
   - Remove all direct DOM manipulation
   - Implement event handlers that use ChessEngine API

3. **Step 3: Update Square and Piece Components**
   - Remove DOM manipulations
   - Make them controlled by props from parent
   - Ensure drag-and-drop works without DOM dependencies

4. **Step 4: Complete Move Logic in ChessEngine**
   - Implement all special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
   - Add check/checkmate detection
   - Implement move validation

5. **Step 5: Sound and Feedback**
   - Move sound logic to a higher-level component
   - Connect sound events to ChessEngine state changes
   - Use a pub/sub pattern for game events

6. **Step 6: Testing**
   - Add unit tests for ChessEngine
   - Test edge cases in chess rules
   - Test UI interactions

## Benefits of Refactored Implementation

1. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation between UI and game logic
   - Easier to understand and modify chess rules
   - Better code organization

2. **Testability**
   - Pure functions are easier to test
   - Isolated components can be tested individually
   - Reduced side effects make tests more reliable

3. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new features (e.g., time control, variants)
   - Engine can be used with different UIs
   - Game state can be serialized/deserialized

4. **Performance**
   - Reduced DOM operations
   - More efficient state updates
   - Better React rendering performance

## Migration Plan

1. **Parallel Implementation**
   - Keep existing code working while implementing new architecture
   - Create new components alongside existing ones
   - Use feature flags to toggle between implementations

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each refactored component individually
   - Compare behavior with original implementation
   - Fix issues before proceeding to next component

3. **Final Switchover**
   - Once all components are refactored and tested
   - Replace old components with new ones
   - Remove old code and dependencies

## Current Status

- ✅ Created domain models (GameState, Piece, Square, Move)
- ✅ Created ChessEngine with core functionality
- ✅ Created refactored Chessboard component
- ✅ Enhanced drag and drop functionality
- ✅ Implemented sound feedback system
- ✅ Fixed visual feedback during drag operations
- ❌ Need to implement all chess move logic in ChessEngine
- ✅ Updated Square and Piece components
- ✅ Migrated from Vite to Next.js
- ❌ Need to add tests

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of all move logic in ChessEngine
2. Update any remaining components to work with the new Next.js architecture
3. Add unit tests for ChessEngine
4. Integrate with the existing application
5. Conduct comprehensive testing

## Migration to Next.js

The project has been successfully migrated from Vite to Next.js with the following changes:

### Changes Made:

- ✅ Updated `package.json` with Next.js dependencies
- ✅ Created Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`) with GitHub Pages support
- ✅ Created Next.js pages structure (`pages/_app.tsx`, `pages/_document.tsx`, `pages/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated TypeScript configuration for Next.js
- ✅ Created Next.js environment types file (`next-env.d.ts`)
- ✅ Updated ESLint configuration for Next.js
- ✅ Moved assets to Next.js `public/` directory structure
- ✅ Updated asset paths in components to use Next.js public folder
- ✅ Removed Vite-specific files (`vite.config.js`, `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated task configuration for Next.js

### Benefits of Next.js Migration:

- Better SEO support with server-side rendering capabilities
- Improved build optimization and code splitting
- Better developer experience with hot reloading
- Enhanced production deployment options
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Better static asset handling
