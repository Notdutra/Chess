  test("should validate premoves before opponent move animation", () => {
    // This test verifies the fix where premove validation happens
    // BEFORE opponent move animation, ensuring clean board state

    // The fix ensures that:
    // 1. When opponent makes a move that invalidates premoves
    // 2. Premoves are cleared BEFORE the opponent's move animation starts
    // 3. Board state is reset to show only real pieces (no preview pieces)
    // 4. Then opponent's move is animated cleanly
